Eddie Prislac hails from Katy, TX, just outside west Houston.

Used to wear a uniform to work, now he rarely changes out of his pajamas
(working remote is AWESOME).

Eddie specializes in Javascript, Ruby, and Rails, but has been branching out into Typescript, Angular and React of late. He's also worked professionally in C#, PHP, Actionscript and VBScript, and used to do a lot of design work.

He currently works on Railroad19's NBC team, where he is a project co-lead for their PAM ad-sales software.
